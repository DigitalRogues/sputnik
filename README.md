> **Sputnik** enables you to connect to CloudKit from within your Golang package using the Server-to-server communication that CloudKit provides.

### Create a signing identity

Talking to CloudKit requires authentication. Luckily, there is a command to create the signing identity for you.

`./sputnik identity create`

This will create a `eckey.pem` and `cert.der` and place it in the `~/.sputnik/secrets` folder.

### Add public key to CloudKit Dashboard

You may print out the key in a CloudKit understandable format. Copy the output and paste it as described in the **Storing the Server-to-Server Public Key and Getting the Key Identifier** section of [the reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/CloudKitWebServicesReference/SettingUpWebServices.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015240-CH24-SW6)

`./sputnik identity`

### Store the CloudKit Key ID

Once you added your public key to CloudKit's server-to-server keys you will get a Key ID for your client. You can store this key by either

`./sputnik keyid store <your key id>`

or setting the environment variable

`SPUTNIK_CLOUDKIT_KEYID`

### Remove an existing signing identity

You can remove the Sputnik signing identity by

`./sputnik identity remove`

This will remove the signing identity local to your machine (any certificate & stored key ID) - it is up to you to revoke the key in the CloudKit Dashboard.

### Usage

[Baikonur](https://github.com/q231950/baikonur) uses Sputnik to insert cities into iCloud. The following is assuming **json** to be some meaningful data.

```go
keyManager := keymanager.New()
containerID := "iCloud.com.elbedev.bish"
subpath := "records/modify"
database := "public"

config := requesthandling.RequestConfig{Version: "1", ContainerID: containerID}
requestManager := requesthandling.New(config, &keyManager, database)

request, error := requestManager.PostRequest(subpath, json)
client := &http.Client{}
response, error := client.Do(request)
```

## State

Even though this library works fine for [Baikonur](https://github.com/q231950/baikonur), please keep in mind that it's a [0.0.2](https://github.com/q231950/sputnik/releases).
