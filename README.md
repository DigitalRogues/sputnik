> **Sputnik** enables you to connect to CloudKit from within your Golang package using the Server-to-server communication that CloudKit provides.

### Create a signing identity

Talking to CloudKit requires authentication. Luckily, there is a command to create the signing identity for you.

`./sputnik identity create`

This will create a `eckey.pem` and `cert.der` and place it in the `~/.sputnik/secrets` folder.

### Add public key to CloudKit Dashboard

You may print out the key in a CloudKit understandable format. Copy the output and paste it as described in **Storing the Server-to-Server Public Key and Getting the Key Identifier** section of [the reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/CloudKitWebServicesReference/SettingUpWebServices.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015240-CH24-SW6)

`./sputnik identity`

### Store the CloudKit Key ID

Once you added your public key to CloudKit's server-to-server keys you will get a Key ID for your client. You can store this key by either

`./sputnik keyid store <your key id>`

or setting the environment variable

`SPUTNIK_CLOUDKIT_KEYID`

### Remove an existing signing identity

You can remove the Sputnik signing identity by

`./sputnik identity remove`

This will remove the signing identity local to your machine (any certificate & stored key ID) - it is up to you to revoke the key in the CloudKit Dashboard.

### Usage

This is one sample GET request to CloudKit, using a specific container ID. If you want to make this request working for you, you need to change the container ID in `requestmanager.go` and recompile.

`./sputnik ping`

## State

> It's a 0.0.2
