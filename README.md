## Server to server communication

### Create the EC key

Talking to CloudKit requires authentication. Luckily, there is a command to create the key for you.

`./sputnik eckey create`

This will create a `eckey.pem` and `cert.der` and place it in the `~/.sputnik/secrets` folder.

### Add EC key to CloudKit Dashboard

You may print out the key in a CloudKit understandable format. Copy the output and paste it as described in [the reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/CloutKitWebServicesReference/SettingUpWebServices/SettingUpWebServices.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015240-CH24-SW8)

`./sputnik eckey`

### Store the Cloudkit Key ID

Once you added your public key to Cloudkit's server-to-server keys you will get a Key ID for your client. You can store this key by

`./sputnik keyid store <your key id>`

or by setting the environment variable

`SPUTNIK_CLOUDKIT_KEYID`

### Remove an existing signing identity

You can remove the Sputnik signing identity by

`./sputnik eckey remove`

### Ping Shelve

This is one sample GET request to Cloudkit, using a specific container ID. If you want to make this request working for you, you need to change the container ID in `requestmanager.go` and recompile.

`./sputnik ping`
